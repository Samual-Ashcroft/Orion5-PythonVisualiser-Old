# Orion5-PythonVisualiser-Old
 This is the first version of the Orion5 visualiser/controller made in python with pyglet/openGL

Open an admin priveleges powershell or cmd line, navigate to the repository and run this: 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt', that should fix you up in terms of required libraries to run it. You could also open a cmd line in that folder, or a powershell, or look in that txt file and install them however.

or 'pip3 install pyglet' and 'pip3 install rawrobotics-orion5'

It does not need a robot arm to be usable.
