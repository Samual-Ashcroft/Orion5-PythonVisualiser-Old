Open an admin priveleges powershell or cmd line, navigate to the repository and run this: 'pip3 install requirements.txt', that should fix you up in terms of required libraries to run it. You could also open a cmd line in that folder, or a powershell, or look in that txt file and install them however.

It does not need a robot arm to be usable.
